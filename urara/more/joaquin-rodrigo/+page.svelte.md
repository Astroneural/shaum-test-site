From the opening notes, Rodrigo paints with summer colors and a Spanish elan. This recognizably Spanish and yet unique sound permeates many of Rodrigo’s works, especially those for guitar. When one closes their eyes, they can see a brilliant, warm sunset setting over spain. Something Rodrigo himself could not even remember.

## Biography

At the age of just three, Rodrigo caught diphtheria. He was nearly completely blinded.

Still, from a young age, he chose to study music. In Europe, he met many of the greats of the time: Paul Dukas became his teacher, later it was Manuel de Falla; Maurice Ravel and Igor Stravinsky became his acquaintances. It was in Europe that Rodrigo began studying music that would influence his own.

In 1933, he married a Turkish pianist. Soon after, in Madrid, he was inspired to compose his Concierto de Aranjuez. The concerto saw immense success and brought Rodrigo to the international stage. He continued composing large works as concertos for a variety of instruments: many for at least one guitar, the Concierto Heróico for piano, a violin concerto with summer sentiment, a cello concerto, and even a harp concerto. He also composed several miniatures for one or very few instruments.

Rodrigo could both read and write music in braille. His method of composing included waiting for inspiration, using a machine to write the music in braille, and dictating further notes. He then listened to the music on the piano to revise it.

All of Rodrigo’s music is considered to be “neoclassical,” and certainly are apt examples of Romantic era music. In guitar concertos, it strums colors and vague thoughts of longing; in the violin concerto, it sings emotion; and in the piano concerto, it roars with energy. All of his music, however, is alive. It shows life through these colors, thoughts, emotions, and feelings, all intertwined and yet distinct enough to tell the heart how to react.

Joaquín Rodrigo passed away in 1999, two years after the death of his beloved wife.
