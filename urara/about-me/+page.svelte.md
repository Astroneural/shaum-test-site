Hi, I'm Shaumprovo Debnath. I like a lot of things, including the sciences, mathematics, and art. In particular, I'm fascinated by computer science, but my real passion is astrophysics, which I hope to study someday to unlock the secrets of the universe. I also like classical music, and I play the violin and piano. I love particularly love reading classical literature and science topics I am interested in, among other genres.

I have done research using an electroencepholagram in which I collected data from myself thinking the letters "A" and "B," then used a neural network model to classify the data. This project earned me Best in Fair and First Grand Prize at the regional level, and first in category at the state level. 

As for hobbies, this past season I played for the varsity soccer team at my school. I enjoy reading various genres, including the classics, realistic and historical fiction, and non-fiction on space and the brain. Additionally, I enjoy teaching: I tutor my school's middle school math club and have recently began expanding through Sal Kahn's https://schoolhouse.world. 

On my website I will publish some of the writing I have done on the topics I enjoy.
