## Interests
Hi, I'm Shaumprovo Debnath. I like a lot of things, including the sciences, mathematics, and art. In particular, I'm fascinated by computer science, but my real passion is astrophysics, which I hope to study someday to unlock the secrets of the universe.

I have done research using an electroencepholagram in which I collected data from myself thinking the letters "A" and "B," then built a neural network model using Python to classify the data. This project earned me Best in Fair and First Grand Prize at the regional level, and first in category at the state level. 

## Hobbies
This past season I played for the varsity soccer team at my school. I play both the piano and violin, classical being my favorite genre of music. I enjoy reading various genres, including the classics, realistic and historical fiction, and non-fiction on space and the brain. Additionally, I enjoy teaching: I tutor my school's middle school math club and have recently began expanding through Sal Kahn's https://schoolhouse.world. 

On my website I will publish some of the writing I have done on the topics I enjoy.
