      <![CDATA[<p>Before you continue with this article, I’d recommend you first play the most famous work by Joaquín Rodrigo, the “Concierto de Aranjuez.”</p><div><div class="flex justify-center mb-12"></div></div><p>From the opening notes, Rodrigo paints with summer colors and a Spanish elan. This recognizably Spanish and yet unique sound permeates many of Rodrigo’s works, especially those for guitar. When one closes their eyes, they can see a brilliant, warm sunset setting over spain. Something Rodrigo himself could not even remember.</p><h2 id="biography"><a href="#biography">Biography</a></h2><p>At the age of just three, Rodrigo caught diphtheria. He was nearly completely blinded.</p><p>Still, from a young age, he chose to study music. In Europe, he met many of the greats of the time: Paul Dukas became his teacher, later it was Manuel de Falla; Maurice Ravel and Igor Stravinsky became his acquaintances. It was in Europe that Rodrigo began studying music that would influence his own.</p><p>In 1933, he married a Turkish pianist. Soon after, in Madrid, he was inspired to compose his Concierto de Aranjuez. The concerto saw immense success and brought Rodrigo to the international stage. He continued composing large works as concertos for a variety of instruments: many for at least one guitar, the Concierto Heróico for piano, a violin concerto with summer sentiment, a cello concerto, and even a harp concerto. He also composed several miniatures for one or very few instruments.</p><p>Rodrigo could both read and write music in braille. His method of composing included waiting for inspiration, using a machine to write the music in braille, and dictating further notes. He then listened to the music on the piano to revise it.</p><p>All of Rodrigo’s music is considered to be “neoclassical,” and certainly are apt examples of Romantic era music. In guitar concertos, it strums colors and vague thoughts of longing; in the violin concerto, it sings emotion; and in the piano concerto, it roars with energy. All of his music, however, is alive. It shows life through these colors, thoughts, emotions, and feelings, all intertwined and yet distinct enough to tell the heart how to react.</p><p>Joaquín Rodrigo passed away in 1999, two years after the death of his beloved wife. </p><p>Edit 5/13/23:I saw Concierto de Aranjuez live in concert!</p>]]>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div><div class="flex justify-center mb-12"></div></div><p>This past spring break I visited New York City where I saw Jean-Yves Thibaudet perform the Turangalîla Symphonie with the New York Philharmonic. It premiered in 1919 by the famous conductor Leonard Bernstein, who also composed the music for “West Side Story.” The symphony, however, was composed by the French composer Oliver Messiaen. So, if you’re interested in music or just wanted to go down a rabbit hole of something you never thought about, why not learn about Messiaen and his masterpiece?</p><h3 id="messiaen"><a href="#messiaen">Messiaen</a></h3><p>Oliver Messiaen was somewhat of a prodigy, for he was able to teach himself to play piano and was accepted into the Paris Conservatory at just age eleven. The conservatory produced some of the most well-known composers and players of the Romantic era, such as Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, Camille Saint-Saëns, Erik Satie, and Pablo de Sarasate. In its time, it was the forefront of new music. Debussy and Ravel pioneered Impressionism—which exchanges melody for harmony to paint “colors”—in classical music, and likewise Messiaen was at the forefront of a new type of music: microtonal. This makes use of notes in between the familiar 12 (A, A#, B, C, C#…) that have been used for centuries. Thus, it has a very unique sound. One of Messiaen’s most famous works that makes use of this is called “Quartet For the End of Time.” The frightening work was composed while Messiaen was confined in a German prisoner-of-war camp during World War II and was first  played at the camp with himself at the piano.</p><h3 id="the-symphony"><a href="#the-symphony">The Symphony</a></h3><p>Turangalîla was written as a love song and was inspired by the pentatonic and octatonic scale of Indian music. The piece makes use of a large orchestra, a piano, and a unique instrument: the ondes Martenot. This instrument has a sort of spooky, whistley, electric sound and is often used in a horror context. It uses a keyboard and a ring, but it’s better explained by this video. The symphony lasts about an hour and twenty minutes (long even for a symphony) and the chaos is even lulling, yet one still gets the feeling that there is a story being told. </p><p>“Joie du Sang des Étoiles” is probably the most famous movement, and it contains the most clear message of joy. It literally means “Joy of the Blood of Stars.” The name of the symphony derives from two Sanskrit words, although he says the true meaning is untranslatable. Messiaen wrote,</p><blockquote><p>Turangalîa means, all at the same time, song of love, hymn to joy, time, movement, rhythm, life and death.</p></blockquote><p>Messiaen’s symphony, in its own unique way, successfully portrays the goal of music: emotion. </p>]]>

Over the past few years, however, the game has exploded in popularity. It began during the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone was staying at home, watching Netflix and the like. One of the more popular shows at the time was The Queen’s Gambit. After watching the show, many viewers, young people especially, were inspired to begin playing chess online, specifically on Chess.com and Lichess.org. </p><p>After starting to play, players wanted to get better in order to beat their opponents, so they turned to YouTube. International Master (IM) Levy Rozman saw growth on YouTube, as well as Grandmaster (GM) Hikaru Nakamura—one of the best chess players in the world—on Twitch, streaming for several hours every day. The game even attracted influencers from totally different fields, such as Mr. Beast collaborated with Hikaru and the online “Pogchamps” tournament, featuring many popular streamers such as “Ludwig,” “penguinz0,” and “xQc.”</p><p>Following this sudden popularity, things seemed to die down, although still more people were playing than ever. Then, in September 2022, the Sinquefield Cup began. However, just before the start of the tournament, one of the players had to drop out. GM Hans Niemann, a 19-year-old prodigy from San Francisco, CA with one of the fastest rating games in history (although very few at the time were aware of him) replaced the player. In one round, Niemann was paired against GM Magnus Carlsen. At the time, Niemann was rated around 2650 in the ELO system, a rating system where you gain or lose points based on your opponent’s rating and the result of the game. Carlsen—five-time world chess champion and indisputable best player in the world—was rated around 2850, an incredible rating difference at the highest level. Furthermore, Carlsen had the white pieces, which go first, giving him a slight, but important, advantage. </p><p>Carlsen lost—his first loss in a classical game in 53 games. </p><p>Then, he withdrew from the tournament. The first time he had ever done such a thing.</p><p>Then, the cheating allegations began. </p><p>Then, the news reached the world, being published by the biggest news outlets, including the Wall Street Journal, the Guardian, and the New York Times. Chess had once again reached a global audience.</p><p>Then, in early 2023 was the latest explosion in the popularity of chess: the Mittens chess bot.</p><p>Every month, Chess.com releases a new series of chess bots, or algorithms that can respond to your moves. Each of them has a different strength and personality, exhibited in playstyle and a little small talk during the game. For the month of January, the theme was cats. However, something was different this time. The strongest of the bots, Mittens, had an unknown rating, but it was stronger than the previously highest rated bot on Chess.com, which was 3200 (Chess.com uses the Glicko 1 rating system, which is different from the ELO system. Magnus Carlsen has a rating of about 3300 on Chess.com). The point is: Mittens was strong. Really strong. Then, the regular chess YouTubers began making videos on it, and Hikaru Nakamura even played it to a draw. These videos exploded in popularity and again, millions were introduced to chess, making it more popular than ever. With hundreds of thousands of concurrent games, even the servers couldn’t handle it. Soon after, Ludwig, the aforementioned streamer who became more popular than ever, hosted the Mogul Chessboxing tournament, which saw hundreds of thousands of concurrent viewers. </p><p>Over the course of the past few years, chess has grown immensely. Pretty impressive for a game more than a thousand years old. I’ll leave you with the Google Trends data for the search term “chess” over the past five years in the United States.</p><div class="overflow-x-auto mb-4"><table class="table w-full"><thead><tr><th align="center"><img src="https://keystonekeynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ChessGraph_3-768x247.jpg" alt="https://keystonekeynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ChessGraph_3-768x247.jpg" class="rounded-lg my-2" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>“Chess Popularity Over Time”</em></td></tr></tbody></table></div>]]>

But how do they work? </p><p>The first step for any AI is training, where it gets pre-labeled data. In the case of art AIs, it’s images. Problem is, it’s hard for a computer to process an image like we do, so instead, the RGB values of the image are put into a large array. Now, the computer needs to be taught what image the data portrays. This is done through labels, often in numerical format, which are often kept separate from the images in another array. After you have that, just give the computer a thousand more samples for an image with the same label. This process is called training, and must be repeated for each image in the training dataset. Say the first image was of an apple, then also throw in some oranges. After thousands of iterations, also known as epochs, it might finally know the difference between an apple and an orange. But how do you know? To test it, you get some more images of apples, but also throw in some oranges. This time, however, don’t give it the labels. It has to come up with them itself. Also, make sure the computer has never seen these images before, for it might have memorized the training images completely, causing a tiny change  such as a different angle in the image to confuse the computer. If it works, you’re ready to move on to pears. Once the AI knows the defining features of an object, it should be able to replicate them. </p><div class="overflow-x-auto mb-4"><table class="table w-full"><thead><tr><th align="center"><img src="https://keystonekeynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/AIArt_1.png" alt="https://keystonekeynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/AIArt_1.png" class="rounded-lg my-2" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>“Realistic photo of a robotic artist living in a walnut shell”</em></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Now, it can get words from a human, convert it to numbers through a process called natural language processing, and make images based on its previous knowledge. But to combine concepts requires “creativity,” or at least, a series of calculations that mimics the way a human would creatively do something. If you’ve been following carefully, you’ll notice everything began with humans. Everything the artistic AI comes up with must be based on something a human has previously done. There won’t be any universal secrets revealed. </p><p>This was a very basic introduction to art generation AIs and many of the concepts here could be applied to artificial intelligence in general. In reality, however, there are a lot of nuances here in the type of neural networks (fancy node-based calculations) used and their parameters. Hopefully, however, you were enlightened and intrigued enough to make or use some AI yourself—the options are limitless. You can play around with Dream by Wombo, or another AI, Neural Blender right now. So, why not get started?</p>]]>
